 # LOCAL SETUP
 1. Install a local web server: You can use software like XAMPP (available for Windows, macOS, and Linux) or MAMP (available for macOS) that bundles Apache web server, PHP, and MySQL. Install the appropriate software for your operating system.

2 Set up the web server:
Launch XAMPP/MAMP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
Configure Apache to serve files from a specific directory. This directory will be the root folder for your project.

3 Database setup:
Open phpMyAdmin (accessible via XAMPP/MAMP control panel) or any other MySQL client.
Create a new database for your project.
Import your database schema or create the necessary tables and data manually.

4 Project folder structure:
Create a new folder in the appropriate directory served by the web server (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP, htdocs or www for MAMP).
Place all your project files inside this folder. Organize them into subdirectories like "css," "js," "images," etc.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

5 Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) in your project folder.
Write your HTML code, including references to CSS and JavaScript files.
Put CSS files in the "css" subdirectory and JavaScript files in the "js" subdirectory.
Link Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files by either downloading them and placing the files in the respective folders or using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to include them directly in your HTML file.

6. PHP and MySQL integration:
Rename your HTML file to have a .php extension (e.g., index.php).
Start writing PHP code within the PHP tags <?php ?>.
Use appropriate PHP functions to connect to your MySQL database and perform database operations.

7 Test your setup:
Open a web browser and visit http://localhost/your-project-folder/index.php.
Make sure you see your project running correctly without any errors.
